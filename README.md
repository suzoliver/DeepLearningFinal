# DeepLearningFinal
Final project code for Deep Learning Fall 2024

This project consists of three colab notebooks.

Deep_Learning_Project_Main: 
This contains the main code of the project, including the data pre-processing, model definition, and training steps. From here, the data and train results can be saved to use for plotting later.

DataLeakFakeSignalTest:
This is the code for the Leak Test section of the paper, where fake data is generated and input to the model to see if the flipping issue is sufficient information for the model to train, even when the data and labels are completely random.

FigureGen:
This is the code used to generate Figures 3, 4, and 5 in the report.

I have also uploaded the pre-processed data, both with and without the gumpy flipping bug in the .npy files
